# PyDebugToolkit: A Python-based Software Debugging Tool

Welcome to PyDebugToolkit, an intuitive toolkit designed to monitor software processes, identify technical issues, generate reports, and offer potential solutions.

## Features

- **Process Monitoring**: Continuously monitors specified software processes for any abnormalities.
- **Issue Identification**: Analyzes CPU and memory usage to identify potential issues.
- **Automatic Reporting**: Generates detailed reports when issues are identified, saving them to a text file.
- **Solution Recommendations**: Provides recommendations for identified issues to guide users toward potential solutions.

## Installation

To use PyDebugToolkit, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you haven't installed Python yet, download and install it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PyDebugToolkit.git

Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:
cd PyDebugToolkit
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To monitor a specific process, use the `ProcessMonitor` class from the `pydebugtoolkit` module. Here is an example:
```python
from pydebugtoolkit import ProcessMonitor

if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_monitor = ProcessMonitor("example_process.py")
    process_monitor.start_monitoring()
Save this script in the examples directory and run it while the process you want to monitor is active.
